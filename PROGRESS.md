# Pulsefall — Progress Ledger

Last documentation update: 2026-08-31

## Current state

- Overall status: F00–F02 complete; F03 not started.
- Last completed feature: F02 — Normal enemy and spawn system.
- Current feature: None.
- Next feature: F03 — Auto-combat, damage, and defeat.
- Next action: Generate `plans/F03_auto_combat_damage_defeat.md` from the feature plan template after inspecting the completed F02 baseline; include lightweight enemy/enemy and enemy/player separation without pathfinding or hard body blocking.
- Known blockers: None.

## Verification baseline

F00 established a runnable Godot project and repeatable verification baseline.

F01 added a moving player, following camera, and bounded camera-relative repeating grid. On 2026-08-31, the headless import, F00 regression, focused F01 verification, and main-scene smoke commands passed. Rendered 1152×648 initial/traveled frames and an 800×450 resized frame were visually inspected successfully; the travel capture reached player world X about 1595 while remaining centered.

F02 added a reusable direct-chasing normal enemy and a timer-driven, camera-aware spawner with centralized interval, margin, and hard population cap. On 2026-08-31, import/parser, F00/F01 regressions, focused F02 verification, a 600-iteration smoke run, and `git diff --check` passed. Rendered populated origin and traveled frames were inspected; after player world X reached about 1915, enemy presentation and camera-relative behavior, floor coverage, and fixed HUD remained correct.

Local Godot environment verified on 2026-08-30:

- GUI executable: `C:\MyFiles\Godot\Godot_v4.7.1-stable_win64.exe`
- Console executable for command-line checks: `C:\MyFiles\Godot\Godot_v4.7.1-stable_win64_console.exe`
- Version command: `& 'C:\MyFiles\Godot\Godot_v4.7.1-stable_win64_console.exe' --version`
- Version result: `4.7.1.stable.official.a13da4feb`

Passing F00 commands on 2026-08-30:

- Headless import/parser check: `& 'C:\MyFiles\Godot\Godot_v4.7.1-stable_win64_console.exe' --headless --editor --path . --quit`
- Focused foundation check: `& 'C:\MyFiles\Godot\Godot_v4.7.1-stable_win64_console.exe' --headless --path . --script res://tests/verify_f00.gd`
- Main-scene smoke run: `& 'C:\MyFiles\Godot\Godot_v4.7.1-stable_win64_console.exe' --headless --path . --quit-after 2`
- Visual check: rendered and inspected the HUD at the default window and a requested 800×450 resized window; both passed after correcting the responsive stat layout.

## Active blockers and known issues

- No blockers.
- Known F02 behavior scheduled for F03: enemies currently overlap exactly when converging. F03 must add lightweight separation so crowds remain readable and enemies do not sit directly atop the player, without introducing pathfinding or hard body blocking.

## Decision log

| Date | Decision | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2026-08-30 | Use the name Pulsefall. | Fits the neon pulse ability and escalating enemy swarm. |
| 2026-08-30 | End runs after five upgrade selections and one boss rather than a timer. | Preserves the desired progression loop while bounding run length and implementation scope. |
| 2026-08-30 | Use an endless-looking unobstructed arena rather than procedural terrain topology. | Provides the intended presentation without requiring pathfinding or chunk persistence complexity. |
| 2026-08-30 | Split work into F00–F09 and create detailed feature plans just in time. | Lets independent sessions use current code and verification evidence instead of stale up-front assumptions. |
| 2026-08-31 | Schedule lightweight enemy/enemy and enemy/player separation for F03. | The F02 manual play check showed exact stacking reduces crowd readability; F03 already owns contact and damage behavior. |

## Latest handoff

F02 is complete. The project now has one reusable direct-chasing normal enemy plus a camera-aware off-screen spawner with centralized tuning, a dedicated enemy container/group, and a hard active-enemy cap. All automated checks and rendered origin/traveled inspection passed on 2026-08-31. A subsequent manual play check identified exact enemy stacking; the roadmap now assigns lightweight enemy/enemy and enemy/player separation to F03 alongside contact damage. The next session should inspect this baseline and generate the F03 plan with that requirement; do not implement F03 without that plan or an explicit implementation request.
